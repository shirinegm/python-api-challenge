Homework 6

Part I
Run the WeatherPy notebook. Beware that the code that calls the OpenWeatherAPI runs for 15min and collects data from around 600 cities. Since my quota is of 1000 calls per day, it can only be called once a day. The code will generate a csv with that data that will be used in the second part. The code will generate png files for all charts

Part II
Run the VacationPy notebook. The ideal cities are limited to below 15 so it will be well within the Google api rate constraints.
